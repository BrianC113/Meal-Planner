# Meal-Planner
## Student Management System

This is a simple Python-based system for managing and planning meals that I built during my first semester at university. It allows users to log in, browse existing recipes, and organize a weekly meal plan in a user-friendly way.


## Features
- User login and logout
- View pre-existing recipes
- Add new meals
- Remove/Edit meal of choice
- View weekly plan(random)

## Technologies
- Python 3.13.1 (IDLE Shell)
- Notepad++ for editing  

## What I learned
This project helped me strengthen my understanding of Python concepts, including 
- File handling 
- Data storage
- Conditional logic and loops
- Basic user authentication
- How to structure a small-scale application effectively.

## Future improvements
- Add a graphical user interface(GUI)
- Improve the user login system with stronger validation and error handling
- Enhance recipe management by allowing easier editing, searching, and categorizing of meals
- Refine the weekly plan feature to allow custom preferences or dietary restrictions
